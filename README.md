I believe in the power of Empathy-Driven Development.
I specialize in efficient React applications, employing the encapsulated logic of Hooks and Context API with an emphasis on clean responsive design.
I also love public speaking. Some of my recent tech talks include:

- "What, Why, and How of React Fiber" | â€‹SingleSprout Speaker Series.
- "Frontend Frameworks Alternatives - Vue.js" | â€‹SingleSprout Speaker Series.
